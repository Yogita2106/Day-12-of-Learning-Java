# Day-12-of-Learning-Java
In the day 12 I have learn about the topic UDP &amp; URL PROCESSING and made the program based on { Converting the string to Uppercase, Reversing the strings, Calculating the Factorial , URL Information }.

The problems are as following:-

Q1. Demonstrate a Java program using UDP where the UDPClient sends a lowercase string to the UDPServer, and the UDPServer converts the string to uppercase and sends it back to 
    the client. Use the class names UDPClient and UDPServer respectively.
    
Q2. Create a Java program using UDP where the UDPClient sends a string to the UDPServer, and the UDPServer reverses the string and sends it back. Use the class names UDPClient 
    and UDPServer.
    
Q3. Write a Java program using UDP where the UDPClient sends an integer number to the UDPServer, and the UDPServer calculates its factorial and sends the result back. Use the 
    class names UDPClient and UDPServer.
    
Q4. Demonstrate a Java program using the URL class with the class name URL_Info, where the program extracts and prints the protocol, host, port, path, and query of the 
    following URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ. Use appropriate methods of the URL class to display each component.
